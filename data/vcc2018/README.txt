Welcome to all participants in the second Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC 2018)! 

—— Task descriptions —— 

This directory contains the training data for the challenge. There are eight source speakers and four target speakers, listed as:

Source speakers: VCC2SF1, VCC2SF2, VCC2SF3, VCC2SF4, VCC2SM1, VCC2SM2, VCC2SM3, VCC2SM4
Target speakers: VCC2TF1, VCC2TF2, VCC2TM1, VCC2TM2

('S' and ’T’ denote 'source' and ‘target,’ respectively, while 'M' and 'F' indicate 'male' and 'female', respectively.)

Each speaker’s folder has 81 sentences. 

VCC2SF1, VCC2SF2, VCC2SM1, and VCC2SM2 have the same set of 81 sentences than the target speakers. ID numbers between 10001 and 10081 are used as the file name. The same file name means the same linguistic content. For example, 'vcc2018_training/VCC2SF1/10001.wav' and 'vcc2018_training/VCC2TF1/10001.wav' are a pair of parallel utterances, having the same linguistic content. These four speakers should be used for the HUB task (that is, parallel voice conversion).

VCC2SF3, VCC2SF4, VCC2SM3, and VCC2SM4 have a different set of 81 sentences from those of the target speakers. ID numbers between 20001 and 20081 are used as the file name. These four speakers should be used for the SPOKE task (that is, non-parallel voice conversion).

VCC2TF1, VCC2TF2, VCC2TM1, and VCC2TM2 are the target speakers for both HUB and SPOKE task. 

The waveforms in the directory are in RIFF/WAVE format. The sampling rate is 22.05 kHz, and stored in 16-bit format. Transcriptions of the waveforms are also available under the Transcription sub folder.

As a participant of VCC2018, you are supposed to build voice conversion systems for the following 16 source-target speaker pair combinations for the HUB task:
VCC2SF1 -> VCC2TF1
VCC2SF1 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SF1 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SF1 -> VCC2TM2 
VCC2SF2 -> VCC2TF1
VCC2SF2 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SF2 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SF2 -> VCC2TM2 
VCC2SM1 -> VCC2TF1
VCC2SM1 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SM1 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SM1 -> VCC2TM2 
VCC2SM2 -> VCC2TF1 
VCC2SM2 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SM2 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SM2 -> VCC2TM2 

If you also participate in the SPOKE task, you are supposed to build voice conversion systems for the following 16 source-target speaker pair combinations __additionally__:
VCC2SF3 -> VCC2TF1
VCC2SF3 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SF3 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SF3 -> VCC2TM2 
VCC2SF4 -> VCC2TF1
VCC2SF4 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SF4 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SF4 -> VCC2TM2 
VCC2SM3 -> VCC2TF1 
VCC2SM3 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SM3 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SM3 -> VCC2TM2 
VCC2SM4 -> VCC2TF1 
VCC2SM4 -> VCC2TF2
VCC2SM4 -> VCC2TM1 
VCC2SM4 -> VCC2TM2 

Evaluation data will be released on December 1st, 2018.
